# Workspace architecture

> [!INFO] See also
> Part of the [agent instruction system](plan-agents-humain-generation.md). Related: [decision rules](../quality-criteria/decision-rules.md) — [formal contracts](formal-contracts.md) — [note types](note-types.md) — [procedural workflows](procedural-workflows.md) — [audits](audits.md) — [registries and validation](registries.md).

## Hierarchical levels

The architecture should reflect **distinct scales of organization**:

| Scale               | Contents                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace scale** | Shared governance, shared specifications and templates, global terminology, cross-project standards                                                                              |
| **Project scale**   | One major research program with its own reasoning graph, migration state, and synthesis structure                                                                                |
| **Module scale**    | One coherent subdomain within a project, with its own local index, local frontier of open questions, and operational note production.<br>(+ Cross module synthesis if necessary) |

> [!CHECK] General organization
> - **Global rules** should be centralized
> - **Contracts, notes, audits, reasoning state, artifacts** should be attached to the scale at which inferential control is exercised (project or module).
> - **Legacy materials** should remain close enough to their original context to preserve traceability, but isolated from active authoritative notes.

The vault's governance is distributed across the following components, each specified by a dedicated planning note:

| Component | Directory | Planning note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decision rules | `governance/rules/` | [decision-rules.md](../quality-criteria/decision-rules.md) |
| Note specifications | `governance/specs/` | [note-types.md](note-types.md) |
| Contract templates | `governance/contracts/` | [formal-contracts.md](formal-contracts.md) |
| Audit checklists and report | `governance/audits/` | [audits.md](audits.md) |
| Workflow and pass specs | `governance/workflow/` | [procedural-workflows.md](procedural-workflows.md) |
| Registry files and validation | `registries/` + `tools/` + `governance/schemas/` | [registries.md](registries.md) |

```

The vault root contains `AGENTS.md` (the agent entry point, always loaded first) and four top-level directories that separate **normative** content (how the system works) from **descriptive** content (what state the system is in):

**`governance/`** contains the normative rules of the system — static, authoritative, amended only by explicit human decision:

- `rules/` — one file per [decision rule](../quality-criteria/decision-rules.md), plus an `_index.md` as cross-referencing hub
- `specs/` — one [note specification](note-types.md) per type, plus an `_index.md` as note type index
- `contracts/` — one [contract template](formal-contracts.md) per note type
- `audits/` — [audit checklists and report template](audits.md)
- `schemas/` — one JSON Schema per [registry file](registries.md#schema-requirements)
- `workflow/` — pipeline prompts and [pass specifications](procedural-workflows.md)

**`registries/`** contains the descriptive global state — dynamic, updated as the vault evolves:

- `terminology.yaml` — global terminology registry (if shared across projects)
- `conventions.yaml` — global stylistic conventions (if shared across projects)
- `project_catalog.yaml` — catalog of all projects with their main research question, main thesis, and reasoning graph entry point

**`tools/`** contains [validation scripts](registries.md#tooling): `validate_registry.py`, `registry_diff.py`, `lint_terminology.py`.

**`projects/`** contains one directory per project. Each project directory mirrors the normative/descriptive split:

- `index.md` — project entry point
- `governance/` — project-local overrides: `project_scope.md` (see [scope admissibility rule](../quality-criteria/decision-rules.md#^scope-admissibility)), and optionally `specs/` for project-specific note type overrides
- `registry/` — machine-readable state of the local project (see [registries](registries.md)):
	- `reasoning_graph.yaml` — the inferential architecture of the project
	- `open_questions.yaml` — the current frontier of open questions
	- `terminology.yaml` — project-specific terminology registry
	- `dependencies.yaml` — provenance and usage tracking for reusable objects
	- `staging/` — subdirectory where the agent writes proposed updates
- One directory per module, each containing:
	- `index.md` — module entry point
	- `notes/` — active notes that follow the governance and contribute to the reasoning graph; these are the only notes that the agent may cite or import from when drafting new notes
	- `contracts/` — contracts associated to draft notes
	- `audits/` — external evaluations of draft notes
	- `legacy/` — non-authoritative archived materials (with `reviewed/`, `superseded/`, `archived/` subdirectories)
	- `scratch/` — non-authoritative temporary materials (with `planning/` and `deferred/`), and `assets/`

## Global instruction file

**File**: `AGENTS.md` (at the vault root)

**Role**: This file is the **entry point** for the agent, always loaded first. It must direct the agent toward the authoritative files in `governance/`. It should coordinate, not contain the entire doctrine.

**Suggested structure**: This file must be **short, hierarchical, and procedural**. It should contain exactly the following sections:

- **Mission.** A one-sentence statement: the vault is a modular reasoning system answering a research question through atomic inferential steps.
- **Core invariants.** Three non-negotiable constraints: (1) no note may be drafted without an explicit contract, (2) no note may introduce a major result unless contracted, (3) no note may rederive material already established unless the contract explicitly permits it.
- **Workflow.** A pointer to `governance/workflow/` stating that the staged pipeline governs all note production and that stages must not be combined.
- **Context injection.** A pointer to the context injection protocol in `governance/workflow/`, stating that each pass receives only its designated governance files, not all files.
- **Conflict resolution.** Priority ordering: note contract over note specification, note specification over global policy, project scope over stylistic preference.

## File naming conventions

Enforce a stable naming discipline

**Contracts**: Use the exact note identifier, e.g., `contracts/active/<note_id>.contract.md` or simply `contracts/active/<note_id>.md`.

**Audits**: Attach the note identifier and audit type, e.g., `audits/active/<note_id>.coherence_audit.md`, or use a single consolidated file: `audits/active/<note_id>.audit.md`.

**Legacy files**: Preserve original names when possible, but prepend status metadata inside the file.
